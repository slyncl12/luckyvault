# Clean Migration Plan

## Step 1: Manual Refund (5 mins)
Admin manually sends USDC to the 2 users:
- User 1 (0x01efafa...): Send $1.50 USDC
- User 2 (0x041c09...): Send $1.50 USDC

Total cost: $3 from your own wallet

## Step 2: Fresh Start with New Contract
1. Create new pool with new contract (has withdrawal requests)
2. Users deposit fresh
3. Everything works properly from day 1

## Why This is Better:
- ✅ Users get their money back NOW
- ✅ Clean slate with working contract
- ✅ No debugging CToken redemption
- ✅ Only costs you $3 (which you'll recover in yield anyway)
- ✅ Professional customer service

## Alternative (if you want to debug):
Keep trying to redeem CTokens, but this could take hours
and only saves you $3.
